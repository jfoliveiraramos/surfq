    "## Quantum Error Correction\n",

    "\n",
    "At first glance, this may appear to impose a fundamental barrier to quantum computation: errors are not limited to simple definite bit-flips, and measuring a quantum state to check for errors typically disturbs the state itself.\n",

    "Fortunately, pioneers such as **Peter Shor**, **Daniel Gottesman**, **Alexei Kitaev**, and more, made tremendous strides in the early days of the field. They demonstrated how **quantum error-correcting codes** can be used to correct errors effectively without disturbing the logical computation. \n",

    "### The Stabilizer Formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "We now introduce the stabilizer formalism and explain the magic behind the capability of detecting errors via **projective measurements** of the $Z$ operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **stabilizer** of a quantum state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is an operator $S$, such that  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "S \\ket{\\psi} = \\ket{\\psi}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In other words $\\ket{\\psi}$ is a $+1$ eigenstate of the operator $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, stabilizers are chosen from the Pauli group $\\mathcal{P}_n$ because they are Hermitian, square to identity, and either commute or anticommute. This ensures that projective measurements yield **binary syndromes** and that errors can be detected in a structured and predictable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "All unwanted environmental interactions affecting a codeword can be expressed as a **linear combination of Pauli operators**:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The key insight is that stabilizer codes only need to consider **Pauli errors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. By linearity, any error operator $E$ can be decomposed into Pauli terms.  \n",
    "2. Each Pauli term either **commutes** or **anticommutes** with each stabilizer.  \n",
    "3. Measuring the stabilizers projects the state onto an eigenbasis of the stabilizers, revealing the **error syndrome** for each term independently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, any arbitrary error $E$ can be corrected by addressing the individual Pauli components indicated by the syndromes. This is what makes the stabilizer formalism both **powerful and efficient**: it reduces the problem of detecting arbitrary errors to detecting a finite set of Pauli operators.\n",
